## üöÄ Overview

Systematic harnesses the power of autonomous AI agents and LSTM neural networks to detect suspicious market activities by:

- **Scraping and analyzing live social data** from platforms such as Reddit, X (Twitter), and TikTok.
- **Correlating sentiment trends** and viral narratives with real-time crypto price movements.
- **Flagging potential pump-and-dump events** before they can cause widespread financial harm.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Systematic Matters

Pump-and-dump schemes cost investors billions annually and undermine trust in digital finance. Major scandals, like the Libra cryptocurrency manipulation in Argentina, show the devastating effects on economies and public confidence.

**Regulators lack effective tools to combat these rapidly evolving schemes.**  
Systematic closes this critical gap by providing real-time, AI-powered threat detection and actionable risk analysis.
